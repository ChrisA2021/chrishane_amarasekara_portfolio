title: Monash Women's Pregnancy Tracker
description: Over the course of a uni year (2 Semesters, 24 weeks) my team and I designed and developed a full-functioning mobile app for our clients Monash Health as part of our university unit FIT3170 (Software Engineering Practice). I was 1 of 4 Project Managers on our team of 17 people and was responsible for communicating with our clients, eliciting requirements, communicating all this back to the rest of the team and creating an environment in which all our team members could excell. Ultimately we created a fantastic Pregnancy Tracker app for Monash Women's providing expectant mothers important infomration about the Pregnancy journey and the facilities at Monash Women's that can help them along the way.
