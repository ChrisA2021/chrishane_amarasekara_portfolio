description: I am currently developing a simple website designed to help university students adapt to and excel at Uni Life! I decided to make this as I was a Science and Engineering Peer Mentor in 2022 and a Senior Science Peer Mentor from 2023-2024 at Monash University. And I've loved supporting first year students as they begin their journey at Monash, and realised in the process that the advice and insights I and other students have to give would be best suited in a dedicated website for everyone to see. 1) My first step was to reach out to a few friends to validate the idea 2) Then I made a TypeForm and ran some Facebooks ads to get some inital users feedback and further validate the idea 3) Now I am developing the website and get some survey responses, please stay tuned for updates!
